                    <p class="paragraph">The World Wide Web (WWW), also known as the Web, is a network of interconnected hypertext documents accessible through the internet. It was initiated by CERN in 1989 and revolutionized how information is shared and accessed by turning the internet into an interactive space. The Web is composed of various websites containing information exchanged through local servers. It was founded by Timothy Berners-Lee, who also leads the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).</p>

                    <p class="paragraph">Users access the Web through web browsers like Internet Explorer, Chrome, etc., which retrieve and display web pages. The Web relies on Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Web browsers provide interfaces for accessing hyperlinked content. The Web includes the deep web, dark web, and surface web, interconnected by hyperlinks. Hypertext allows users to access related information by clicking on links.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph">The Web operates on a client-server model, with servers storing and transmitting documents and clients requesting them. The use of browsers and platforms like Tor allows anonymous browsing. Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) provide online addresses to web pages. Key features include being cross-platform, dynamic, interactive, and open source. The evolution of the Web introduced technologies like JavaScript, CSS3, and HTML5, enabling richer user experiences with animations and real-time updates.</p>
